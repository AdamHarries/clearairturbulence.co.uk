Yesterday saw me merging in some changes from master into an out-of-date feature branch in the project that I work on as part of my PhD. This involved the usual frustration of merge conflicts, and interface changes between the master branch and my code (~4-5 months out of date!), but what really got me down was how long it took to compile and test my code using the default scala SBT tool.
