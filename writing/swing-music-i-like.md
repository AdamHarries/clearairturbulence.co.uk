## Absolute bangers.

Let's start this post on a high note. These are the tracks that I *love* to dance to, and will never resist the opportunity. They might not be everyone's cup of tea, but they're certainly mine. 

**"Is This Love" - The Schwings feat. Migloko.**

Migloko</a></iframe>

The Schwings are a modern jazz band based in Vilnius, Lithuania. Led by their saxophone player, Remigijus Ranƒçys, they play a mixture of original compositions, original swing tunes, and covers of modern (non swing) tunes. This particular tune is beefy, baritone driven cover of Bob Marley's [original reggae version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHekNnySAfM).

Perhaps it's because I used to play Baritone Saxophone, or the catchiness of the main riff, but this tune is my absolute favourite track for dancing collegiate shag. It has a wonderful energy, at a perfect shag tempo (around 200bpm), a really solid driving chunking guitar, and really interesting breaks - perfect for being musical, free, and fun while dancing. 

On a somewhat personal note, this song always reminds me of mine and rebecca's stay in a tiny AirBnB in a top floor flat in Barcelona after BCN Shag Festival 2016. It was absolutely perfect - a tiny studio flat, with a roof terrace larger than the inside, intimate, yet with space, air and freedom. This track reminds me of exactly the emotions I felt then. Connected, yet free, and able to improvise and be with someone without restriction or conflict. 

Lovely. 

**"I&#39;m gonna pick you up in a red dress, baby!" - Dizzy Birds**

What can I say about this track that it isn't possible to simply hear?! To begin with, unfortunately, is the name that is (shall we say) very much of its time[^1]. To be blunt, the title is a racist reference to the dance events held in the "darktown" - i.e. sections of a city predominantly occupied by African-Americans. I'm hesitant in including this in my list of favourite songs, as the title and (some of the) lyrical content does not align with my personal politics. That said, I hope that it's possible to appreciate this track purely on its musical qualities.

**"I'll Fly Away" - The Blue Vipers Of Brooklyn**

I'll fly away is one of those tracks that really inspires me and has helped me to get through tough times. It helps, of course, that it's also a wonderful tune to dance to. It's got a solid chuggy rhythm, some wonderful musicianship, great percussion breaks and a positive energy that practically infuses my dancing and spirit with life.
