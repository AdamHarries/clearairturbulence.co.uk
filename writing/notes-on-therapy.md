abstract: I have a bit of a broken brain, so I've started going to therapy to sort it out. This page contains some of my notes on the process, and tools/exercises for myself to help manage my thoughts.

## The brain cycle.

This came up in our session on 2019-03-21.

When processing a trigger, the brain goes through four stages:

- Thoughts
- Emotional response
- Bodily reactions
- Behavioural changes.

For example, when confronted by a rattlesnake (a trigger), the response might be:

- "Ah, a rattlesnake! I know that their bites can be deadly!"
- Fear
- Bodily reactions to fear, adreneline release - e.g. palpatations, etc etc.
- Running away, shutting down, etc.

The trigger is usually an event, and is usually not (realistically) controllable. The thoughts that we have in reaction to the trigger are, however. They might be negative intrusive thoughts that are (in reality) not valid, or not a good response to the trigger.

For example, given a trigger of "I played some wrong notes during a solo in a jam", the response might be:

- "Ah, I'm bad at playing music, why do I bother??"
- Depression
- Exhaustion
- Wanting to quit music altogether.

In this scenario, although the trigger is "valid" to some degree (I might have really played a wrong note), the thoughts that arrived in response are not valid. For example, the thought "I am bad at playing music" is probably patently false - but is a reaction to playing a single wrong note. If that thought can be captured, made external, or expressed separately from the person, then it can be analysed and the subsequent negative emotions, bodily reactions, and behaviour can also be addressed.
