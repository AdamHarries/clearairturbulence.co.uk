title: Unfinished posts
---

I am crap at writing. Like, really crap. You're reading this, so you know I'm crap. I know it as well, and that puts me off writing - I'm aware that anything that I sit down to write will be below my standards.

In an effort to curb the procrastination that this causes, and to excuse half-baked ideas and prose, I've divided my posts into two rough categories: "unfinished", and (implicitly) "finished". The first category contains posts that I would otherwise not write, out of fear of writing them badly, or worry that a half-finished idea at the core of a post is something I won't be able to do justice. The aim is to have a place to dump *any* writing, whether it is good or not, without the worry that it needs to be a "complete", well expressed, and considered body of text. Unfinished posts also include those that might take a while to write, such as notes taken over a period of time, or other posts that might be impossible to write all at once. 

None of the abov, however, implies that posts in the finished category will be any better than those in the category of finished posts. Rather, the implicit finished category just contains posts that I'm, in some sense, "done with". I may come back to the posts at some point, but they exist in their published state in a form which I am comfortable considering finished.
