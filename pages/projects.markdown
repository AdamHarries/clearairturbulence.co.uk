## [Collegiate Shag Pins](https://wwwi.nstagram.com/p/Bb-EVGyAvwC/)

![](/images/projects/shagpins/pin.jpg "A collegiate shag pin")

Collegiate Shag is a somewhat niche swing dance, with a small community even by the standards of the small swing community. In order to make it easier to find Collegiate Shag dancers at general swing events, I commissioned a run of pins that dancers could wear to indicate that they dance Shag.
