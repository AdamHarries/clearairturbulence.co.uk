I like a lot of things, and I like to think about a lot of things. My usual method for thinking about things is to extemporise at great length towards those around me (usually my significant other, who is sick of it[^1]). In an attempt to save my friends and family from having to listen to my dire drivel, I've decided, instead, to dump it on the internet for all to see. 

You, dear reader, have unfortunately stumbled upon said dump. I do hope you enjoy it. 

[^1]: I jest - my significant other claims to love it when I ramble on about whatever is filling up my head. In her words "it really helps me to get to sleep".
