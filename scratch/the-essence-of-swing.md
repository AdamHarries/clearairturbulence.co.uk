abstract: Changing the semiring underlying a given series of linear algebraic operations is an easy, sound, way to change the semantics of the operations, and thus apply linear algebra to new domains. In this post, I discuss some of the mathematical background for this powerful technique, and demonstrate its usefulness in some non-obvious domains.
