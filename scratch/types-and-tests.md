abstract: It occurs that the oft professed dichotomy between types and tests is anything but, and in fact, bears quite a close resemblance to the relationship between maths and science. This post gives a brief overview of the similarities, and argues (as many do), that neither tests, nor types, are sufficient on their own.

Maths = types - Create models, verify that the model is consistent with itself, predictive, but cannot capture the relationship with hugely complex systems without becoming overly complex in itself, or becoming a high level abstraction. 

Science = tests - Make assumptions clear, create hypothesis, test hypothesis, describe high level interaction and outcome of the system. Cannot function without _some_ mathematical basis in order to create a model.
