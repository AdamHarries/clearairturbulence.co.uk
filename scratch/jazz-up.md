**[The Countdown Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e32kaa9TzeE)** - One o'clock jump style/"reverse head", fastish, with the final change indicating a drum break?

**[Sospan Fach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_aM4Ar73j0)** - In the style of "Song of the Volga Boatmen". See other versions of this song for interesting countermelodies and arrangements.

**[Steamed Hams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUNBpeUHKXQ)** - The most challenging to swing yet. Would probably have to be a somewhat prosaic sung version, with band shouts etc. 

**[Dr Zaius](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-YEw1ExL8c)** - Just swing it!

**[Badinerie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ufehp7gULA)** - Could be done quite nicely in a Benny Goodman/airmail special style?  

**[Stay with me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB-5XG-DbAA)** - Basie style/shiny stockings feel. 

**[Downtown Abbey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NbnQZrK8xA)** - Easy does it styling. 

**[Home/Dirty Paws](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgPSSgP6zzA)** - Based on the [version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHEOF_rcND8) by "Edwarde Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros", which would be particularly fitting given that the drummer (Josh Collazo) plays with Johnathan Stout
